    `cd repo.git`

3. Run git-rewrite-author.

    `git-rewrite-author -oe old@email.com -cn "Correct Name" -ce correct@email.com`

4. Check you are happy with the changes using git log.
5. Make sure you are absolutely happy to continue.
6. Force-push to update the remote repository.

    `git push --force --tags origin 'refs/heads/*'`

7. Delete the bare clone.

    `cd .. && rm -rf repo.git`
